# Scoping Statement

# Introduction – Project Mission & Vision

To engage collaboratively and have fun in the creation of tangible solutions which address a set of challenges concerned with making lives easier for Code Your Future (CYF) volunteers and students.

The project has been tasked with developing a “Tracking Your Students” tool.

# Project Aim

The aim of the project is to focus on dealing with ‘3’ challenges (which will be solved by usage of the tool):

1. Provide Extra Support – CYF students require one-off or ongoing support from professional advice outside of coding (i.e. finance, mentoring etc.). This type of support will help students overcome obstacles to their growth outside of vocational training.

AIM – Create a product or service that could connect them with the right professionals.

2. See the Future – CYF students lack working experience and can't envision the day-to-day requirements of their future careers.

AIM – Craft a system or tool to help them understand the day-to-day working life of a web developer.

3. Class Planner – We currently use a spreadsheet to coordinate planning our classes. Often, volunteers will do something wrong and the spreadsheet will break. it is quite ugly to work with and it's not a great first introduction to CodeYourFuture.

AIM – Replicate the functionality of that spreadsheet in a way that is better designed, more usable and more professional.

# Project Objective

The major focus for the project is to generate new ideas & Following ideas generation develop a low fidelity prototype that will be created and tested with challenge co-ordinators and users wherever possible.

# In – Scope

The scope of this story is to develop a tool for Code Your Future (CYF) volunteers and students to “Track Students Progress” by:

1. Connect them with the right professionals.
2. Understand the day-to-day working life of a web developer.
3. Replicate the functionality of a current spreadsheet in a way that is better designed, more usable and more professional.

2. Front-End developers have access to Development tools – HTML, CSS and ReactJS
3. Back-End developers have access to Development tools – NodeJS
4. UX Designers have access to Development tools – AppDiagrams (https://app.diagrams.net/)

# Project Risks

The following Risks must be taken into account for the Code Your Future (CYF) “Track Students Progress” project:

1. Front-End Developer – Challenges writing the front-end in HTML, CSS and ReactJS.
2. Back-End Developer – Challenges writing the back-end using NodeJS.
3. Product Designer – Challenges in combining both a UX/UI designer role.
4. Project Manager – Challenges to oversee and manage the direction of each challenge.
5. Resources – Unavailability of staff.
6. Technical Connection problems using Google Meet.
7. User Connection problems to the tools AppDiagrams / Git Hub / Miro / Slack / Trello
8. Allocation of Resources to the appropriate skills
9. Poor Time Management – Caused by IT issues / No Decisions / Clash of Ideas / Uncertainty of deliverable.
10. Technical Issues

# Project Constraints

The following Constraints are stated for the Code Your Future (CYF) “Track Students Progress” project:

1. Time – Not all Team 3 members maybe able to attend at 8pm daily for 7 days a week.
Solution – It has been agreed that the team will “decide the next meeting” after the end of a current meeting & Patrick Chan (PM) will email the team with the Time/Date & Agenda
2. Budget – Not Applicable.
3. Access to Collaboration & Development tools eg Need to Sign a CYF Volunteer Agreement sent by Claire.
